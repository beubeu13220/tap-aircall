# tap-aircall

`tap-aircall` is a Singer tap for extracting data from the [aircall API](https://developer.aircall.io/api-references/).

Built with the [Meltano Tap SDK](https://sdk.meltano.com) for Singer Taps.

api_id | True | None | The id to authenticate against the API service
start_date | False | None | The earliest record date to sync in UTC Timezone
stream_maps | False | None | Config object for stream maps capability. For more information check out [Stream Maps](https://sdk.meltano.com/en/latest/stream_maps.html)

A full list of supported settings and capabilities for this
tap is available by running:

```bash
poetry run tap-aircall --about
```

## Installation

- [ ] `Developer TODO:` Update the below as needed to correctly describe the install procedure. For instance, if you do not have a PyPi repo, or if you want users to directly install from your git repo, you can modify this step as appropriate.

```bash
pipx install tap-aircall
```

## Configuration

### Authorization Method

To run tap-aircall, you will need an API ID and an API token. Create a file named .secret/config.json and fill it with an array containing the following fields:

- api_id
- api_token
- start_date

The config file should look like this:
```json
{
    "api_id": "123456789",
    "api_token": "ABCDEFGHI",
    "start_date": "2023-08-07 09:30:00"
  }
```

### Configure using environment variables

This Singer tap will automatically import any environment variables within the working directory's
`.env` if the `--config=ENV` is provided, such that config values will be considered if a matching
environment variable is set either in the terminal context or in the `.env` file.

## Usage

You can easily run `tap-aircall` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).

### Executing the Tap Directly

You can launch the tap in two different ways:

1. **catalog:** this option retrieves all data starting from the date specified in `.secrets/config.json` and updates the `samples/state.json` file with the latest retrieved item.

```bash
./tap-aircall.sh catalog
```

2. **state:** this option retrieves all data starting from the state indicated in `samples/state.json`.


```bash
./tap-aricall.sh state
```

## Developer Resources

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `tap_aircall/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `tap-aircall` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run tap-aircall --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any _"TODO"_ items listed in
the file.

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd tap-aircall
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke tap-aircall --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano elt tap-aircall target-jsonl
```

### SDK Dev Guide

See the [dev guide](https://sdk.meltano.com/en/latest/dev_guide.html) for more instructions on how to use the SDK to
develop your own taps and targets.

## Utilization 
This tap can be used in three differents ways: 
  * Any configuration: fetch all available data for each enable stream
  * `start_date`: fetch data since this date according to the the replication date key 
  * `state`: fetch data since the last update bookmarks according to the replication date key

Nevertheless, it is important to note that any update made to an element in Aircall will not be considered when retrieving data via `state`. This is because there is no replication key such as `updated_at`. In other words, if one wishes to be able to retrieve all data, including updates, it is necessary to run the tap on the entire dataset every time. The only stream for which there are no updates in the strictest sense (or at least no interesting updates to retrieve) is the *Call* stream. This stream also happens to be the one containing the most data by far.  
Therefore, it is advised for the user to use full replication for the `Users`, `Tags`, `Teams`, `Contacts`, and `Numbers` streams, but to use `state` for the `Calls` stream.
